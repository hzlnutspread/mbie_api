# mbie_apie

I overheard my coworkers talking about APIs and how they would like to get information from the New Zealand tenancy
services but didn't know how to do so. I volunteered to help since I had just learned about RESTful API's in Java (as
you can see from my recent RESTful API repository) and thought it would be a good way to test my understanding.

So I took it upon myself to put my new-found knowledge to good use by creating an API client to help my coworker with
his queries. 

When he has questions I use this code to get answers for him.
